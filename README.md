# Downgrader-A4-and-lower
This Is a tether downgrade , every time your device reboots you must boot tether with tether boot .bat file(edited by hacks4live) 
(iMPORTANT :NO NEED TO ENTER PWND DFU ITS AUTOMATICLY HAPPENIG WITH THIS CUSTOM IPSW !!!!!!).
You also need to edit the example .txt to the specific ipsw in order to tether boot
And you need to rename the geekgrade ipsw to downgrade , and paste the GEEKGRADE/ifaithmodded version into  the libmobiledevicerestore folder .  
Instuctions : 
1. Run cmd and locate the libmobiledevicerestore folder 
(cd location )
2. find your udid (unique shit) with redsn0w
4. idevicerestore -e -u your udid -c downgrade.ipsw (put your geekgrade ipsw in the folder and name it as "downgrade" .ipsw and wait whil its restoring .
6. boot tether (make sure the normal apple  ipsw (that must be in your root folder (C:/) and redsn0w as well )
7. setup your device .
8. (Only for Jailbreak) locate your ipsw , select jb , install cydia, make sure you're in DFU mode , jailbreak ,and just boot after .
9. every time you reboot or bettery die's or your cat eat it up , you need to tether boot it with the iphone 4 .bat (rename or edit it in order it for work , example : if you've downgraded on your ipod touch 4g to 5.1.1 ,  rename it to : iPod4,1_5.1.1_9B206_Restore (in )the iphone 4 .bat (the name will change in the full version)
